Of course. Based on the image provided, here is a clear description of its theme and style to help you create a skills tree with a similar vibe.

The theme of this skill tree is best described as **High-Tech Cyberpunk Schematic** or a **Digital Neural Network**. It's designed to look like a futuristic computer interface, a cybernetic enhancement blueprint, or the internal wiring of an advanced piece of technology.

Here are the key elements that create this specific style and vibe:

### 1. Core Aesthetic: The Digital Circuit Board
The entire layout is designed to mimic a printed circuit board (PCB).
* **Connectors as Traces:** The lines connecting the skills are not simple straight lines. They are rigid, angular "traces" that make sharp 90-degree turns, just like the conductive paths on a real circuit board. This is a crucial element for achieving the look.
* **Layered Complexity:** The paths are complex and interwoven, giving the impression of a sophisticated and intricate system. They create a structured, yet busy, technological feel.

### 2. Color Palette: High-Contrast Luminosity
The color scheme is simple but extremely effective at creating a futuristic, digital mood.
* **Primary Color:** A brilliant, luminous **golden-yellow or amber**. This is used for all active elementsâ€”the nodes, icons, and connecting lines. It suggests power, energy, or data flow.
* **Background Color:** A deep, stark **black or dark charcoal**. This high contrast makes the golden elements "pop" and appear to glow, reinforcing the idea of an illuminated screen or active circuitry.

### 3. Shape Language: Angular & Geometric
The design avoids soft curves in favor of hard, geometric shapes.
* **Nodes:** The skill nodes are primarily **squares with clipped or chamfered corners**, giving them a slightly octagonal appearance.
* **Major Nodes:** Key skills or ability tiers are housed in larger, more distinct shapes like **diamonds or ornate octagons**, setting them apart visually as major milestones. This creates a clear visual hierarchy.

### 4. Iconography & Typography: Stylized Silhouettes
The visual language inside the nodes is clean and symbolic.
* **Icons:** The skills are represented by clean, single-color **silhouetted icons**. They often depict figures in dynamic poses (running, fighting), skulls, or abstract technological symbols (wings, targeting reticles). The style is minimalist yet descriptive.
* **Text:** Any text (like the tier names "ROOKIE," "PRO," "PHENOM") is typically a sans-serif, slightly condensed font that looks modern and digital. The numbers indicating skill ranks (e.g., `3/3`) are simple and clear.

### 5. Structure & Hierarchy: Vertical Progression
The layout communicates progression and increasing power in a very direct way.
* **Tiers:** The tree is organized into clear horizontal tiers that represent increasing levels of mastery. This creates a powerful sense of leveling up from a "Rookie" to a "Legend."
* **Columns:** It's structured in distinct vertical columns, likely representing different core playstyles or attributes (e.g., one for stealth, one for combat, one for tech).

### 6. Atmosphere & Effects: Digital Glow
The final touch that brings the theme to life is the lighting.
* **Luminous Glow (Bloom):** All the golden elements have a soft, radiant glow, as if they are self-illuminated. This effect is essential for selling the "active screen" or "powered-on" vibe.
* **Subtle Background Details:** The dark background isn't completely empty. It contains faint, almost subliminal lines, grids, and snippets of code or technical text. This adds depth and reinforces the feeling that you are looking at a complex technical schematic.

To summarize for your own creation:
**Use a dark background with a single, vibrant, glowing color for your active elements. Connect your skills with angular, circuit-like lines. Use geometric shapes for nodes and stylized, minimalist icons to represent the skills. Finally, organize it in a clear hierarchy to show progression.**
